# Title: Analyzing the NBA dataset

This project aims to identify outstanding players through analyzing their player stats through 1996 to 2019. 

Data is taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justinas/nba-players-data

-----------------------------

# Problem Definition:
What makes an NBA player good?
i.  Which statistic did we consider to determine how good a player is and how does other factors affect it?
ii. Can we predict if a player is from draft round 1 or not using that statistic?

-----------------------------

# Models Used:
1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Trees
3. Learning something new: Tableu to generate new data visualisation

-----------------------------

# Conclusion:
1. Not all the players in the dataset can be considered as they might have played in very little games during their respective seasons
2. As years go by, players are scoring more and more points - Could be due to the shift in focus more to the offensive side of Basketball
3. Usage rate is the statistic that affects points a player scores per game the most
4. The decision tree is able to accurately predict if a good player is from draft round 1 or not
5. However, it did not perform so well when it came to predicting the worst players
